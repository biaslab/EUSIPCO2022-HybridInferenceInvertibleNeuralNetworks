**Abstract**

This paper bridges the gap in the literature between normalizing flows and probabilistic graphical models. Normalizing flows are incorporated in factor graphs and inference in this model is described by linearization of the flow. Consequently, hybrid probabilistic inference in the flow-based model is realized through message passing with local constraints on the Bethe free energy. We provide the variational free energy for the normalizing flow node, which allows for evaluation of the performance of the entire probabilistic model. Experimental results show effective hybrid inference in a flow-based probabilistic model for a binary classification task, paving the way towards a novel class of machine learning models.
